Question 1: How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?
Using socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
Quesition 2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?
For server socket , we need to bind socket(assigns an IP address and a port number to the socket), and we can set to listening mode. So a server just waits for a conversation and doesn't start one. For client socket, is created to connect() to a listen() server. The client initiates the connection.

Question 3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1), Since on some OS, it will not let us use the port again for a few minutes without that line, even after it terminates. 

Question 4: What information do we get about incoming connections?
Getting IP address, port information, And the new socket used for receive and send data on the connection(we can use recv function to check recived data) 

Question 5: What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?
The data received from the client.
